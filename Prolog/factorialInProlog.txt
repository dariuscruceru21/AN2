% Base case: The factorial of 0 is 1.
factorial(0, 1).

% Recursive case: The factorial of N is N * factorial of (N-1).
factorial(N, Result) :-
    N > 0,               % check if N is positive
    N1 is N - 1,         % Calculate N-1
    factorial(N1, R1),   % Recursive call to find factorial of N-1
    Result is N * R1.    % Result is N times the factorial of N-1
